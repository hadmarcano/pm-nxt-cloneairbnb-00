## npx prisma init

âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
You can now open it in your favorite editor.

warn You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add `.env` in it to not commit any private information.

Next steps:
e. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started 2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb. 3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema. 4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

## if you have the previous steps completed

RUN:

-   npx prisma db push
